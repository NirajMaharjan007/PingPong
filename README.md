# Ping Pong Game
> Coding from Java with AWT and Swing.


## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Problems not solved

*Note:* Score Board doesn't works and no reset
- If run == false, then doesn't works
- requires to re run the programme
- no separate two inputs 
- has Bugs while colliding Paddles

## Solved Problems
- collision works
- Playable
- can Restart if out of bounds
